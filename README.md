This is one of the projects I did for a Linear Regression class (Stat 506).
This project explores the flight accidents for different flight phases.
The data used is availabel from https://www.kaggle.com/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses and is originated from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/15/ntsb.aviation/AviationQueryHelp.aspx
